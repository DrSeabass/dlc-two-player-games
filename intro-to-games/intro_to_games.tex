  \begin{description}
    \item[Ultra-Weak] Show whether player one wins, loses, or draws given
      perfect play on both sides.
    \item[Weak] Provide an algorithm that secures a win for one player, or a
      draw for either givenany possible move from the opposing player.
    \item[Strong] Provide an algorithm that can play perfectly from
      arbitrary, but legal, board positions.
